# 🧠 SQL Data Warehouse Project

In this repository, you'll find an end-to-end solution that covers the design, development, and use of a **Data Warehouse** to extract valuable insights. This project showcases practical skills and modern techniques used in the field of **Data engineering and analytics**.

---

## 🚀 Objective

To design and build a **Data Warehouse** from scratch, applying best practices in data modeling and processing, with a focus on SQL and the multi-layer architecture: bronze, silver, and gold.

---

## 🧱 Project Architecture

The workflow is based on a classic multi-layer data warehouse design:

### 🟠 Bronze Layer: Raw Data Ingestion

- Ingestion of raw data from various sources.
- Naming conventions and partitioning rules are established.
- Data is stored as-is to preserve traceability.

### ⚪ Silver Layer: Data Cleaning & Transformation

- Standardization and cleaning of raw data.
- Inconsistencies are removed, data types converted, and basic business rules applied.
- Data is refined and made ready for analysis.

### 🟡 Gold Layer: Analytical Modeling

- Dimensional modeling using a star schema.
- Creation of **fact and dimension tables**.
- Data is optimized for Business Intelligence (BI) tools and reporting.

## 🔁 ETL Process

An **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline is implemented throughout the project, guiding the evolution of the data from raw ingestion to a refined analytical model.
